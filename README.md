 # Purpose
 To practice bootstrap using various sections(navbar, hero, service, gallery, contact, footer)

 # Overall
- Convenient to implement. Easily make a responsive website.
- But there's a limit to customization. If it needs to be done in a short time and there's no specific design guide, Bootstrap can be a great option. But otherwise, it's better to make our own.
- Long code lines are hard to read. I feel that code formatting is really important for the frontend side.
